## Hi there!  

Welcome to my personal space, a site that is yet another drop in the vast ocean that is the Internet.  

My name is Sriram V, and I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree (with Honors) in [Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in) at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Madras](http://www.iitm.ac.in). I'm nearly done with my junior year of college, and I'll be interning at Microsoft Research India, in Bangalore, over the next few months.  

You can contact me through any of the social media listed in the sidebar, or you could mail instead at either `me@<my-full-name>.com` or `<initial-followed-by-first-name>@cse.iitm.ac.in`.  

If you're interested in the magic that's powering this site, you could head over [here](/about) to read more. And if you're one of those people (like me!) who prefer a sleek command line interface over a slow, bloated GUI, you could have a look at [this](/terminal).
