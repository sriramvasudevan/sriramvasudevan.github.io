<!--
== Fall 2014
=== Context-Sensitive Spellchecker
Guide: Prof. Sutanu Chakraborti
- Building a spell-checking program that makes relevant suggestions based on the kind of error made.
- The primary algorithm makes use of a Markov Model, with priors being computed from an extensive corpus apriori, as part of the training process.
- Likelihood values are estimated by computing the edit distance between the incorrect word and the suggestion, as well as performing a DFS on the error-graph induced by the Levenshtein Distance computation.
- Extensive indexing techniques have been explored, including the use of Tries, BK Trees, and hashmaps containing a subset of highly likely errors.

== Spring 2014
=== WebRTC Public Crimes
- Put fart here da

=== English to FOL Converter
Guide: Prof. Deepak Khemani
- Wrote a Python program that took everyday English sentences as input, and produced the corresponding Predicate Logic expression.
- The algorithm implemented involved annotating words with Parts-of-Speech tags that were made mildly context sensitive by utilizing a Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG).
- The annotated sentence was then converted to an intermediate Lambda calculus form, from which the corresponding FOL expression was derived.

=== Implementing Table Sheets in LibreOffice Calc
Guide: Prof. P. Sreenivasa Kumar
- Wrote a Python program that took everyday English sentences as input, and produced the corresponding Predicate Logic expression.
- The algorithm implemented involved annotating words with Parts-of-Speech tags that were made mildly context sensitive by utilizing a Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG).
- The annotated sentence was then converted to an intermediate Lambda calculus form, from which the corresponding FOL expression was derived.

=== Remote File Server
Guide: Prof. Shankar Balachandran
- Built a robust packet-drop free UDP connection that allowed remote file access

== Fall 2013
=== Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Product Reviews
Guide: Prof. Balaraman Ravindran
- Built a classifier that predicted the rating of a user for a product given the preprocessed text of his/her review as part of the ML course.
- It won second place in the course contest among all the classifiers built by students of the course.
- You can read more about it here.
- I've also hyperlinked everything possible, from profs, to webpages, to wikipages, to reports to ppts and pdfs to videos.

=== TSP Solver
Guide: Prof. Deepak Khemani
- Developed an algorithm to heuristically approximate the path of least cost to be taken, for a given Travelling Salesman Problem.
- The algorithm combined various techniques to converge quickly at an approximate value.
- The final implementation outpeformed over 50 other algorithms to be rated the second best in the Non-Euclidean category, and the best in the Euclidean TSP category.

=== Ultimate Tic Tac Toe
Guide: Prof. Deepak Khemani
- Developed a website using Django and JavaScript to enable users to play the game, /Ultimate Tic Tac Toe/.
- Devised algorithms of varying difficulties to allow end-users to compete against an AI system, apart from the conventional 2-player gaming mode.

=== TheJoker -- An Othello Bot
Guide: Prof. Deepak Khemani
- Built an Artificially Intelligent Reversi playing bot that placed first among over 50 bots at the intra-institute as well as the national level, in Shaastra 2014.
- The bot made use of the Alpha-Beta search algorithm to traverse the search space, as well as an objective function that included several game-specific heuristics.
- The bot also made use of thread-based parallelisation and a dynamic depth setting to speed up search tree exploration.

=== Space Database Querying Module
Guide: Prof. P. Sreenivasa Kumar
- Designed a database querying framework that could store data related to celestial bodies, manmade satellites and records of journeys to these entities.
- Built an extensive SQL database system incorporating views, joins and other concepts to support the designed framework.
- Scraped the internet to populate the database.
- Performed complex queries to estimate performance measures, and integrated the populated database with Django, to provide a visual frontend.

=== MacroJava Compiler
Guide: Prof. V. Krishna Nandivada
- Built a MacroJava (A MiniJava based grammar with macro definitions) to MIPS compiler in Java, using JTB and JavaCC.
- The flow involved the conversion of MacroJava to MiniJava, typechecking and conversion to an intermediate language called MiniIR, following which subsequent conversions to MicroIR, MiniRA and finally MIPS was done.

=== JOS Kernel and Operating System
Guide: Prof. V. Kamakoti
- Hacked MIT's JOS kernel and implemented new features

== Spring 2013
=== Yahoo! Hack U
- This shag also da

=== Big Integer Library
Guide: Prof. C. Pandu Rangan
- Implemented a Big Integer Library that could play with big nos da

=== Assembly Language Programming
Guide: Prof. V. Kamakoti
- Wrote n assembly level code to do matrix multiplication, paging, context switching etc.

== Fall 2012
=== FPGA-Based Selection Sorter
Guide: Prof. Shankar Balachandran
- Implemented the selection sort algorithm on a XILINX Spartan FPGA board using Verilog.
- Numbers were entered in binary by making use of the inbuilt LEDs, and the implementation provided a live visualisation of the algorithm making use of these LEDs.
