<h1>Sriram Vasudevan &ndash; Bio</h1>
</div>
<p>I'm a senior undergraduate at the <a href="http://www.iitm.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology Madras</a>, majoring in <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in">Computer Science and Engineering</a> with a minor in English Literature. I love exploring the new and unexplored, and this fascination of mine has manifested itself everywhere, right from academia to the extra and co-curriculars. I've taken courses across the board, from post-graduate courses in Theoretical Computer Science to advanced ones in Machine Learning and Artificial Intellgence. Essays and elocutions have piqued my interest in much the same way as adventure sports and trekking have. When it comes to food, I'm always that last person to make up his mind, simply because I have to try out something new every time. I tend to organize everything into mental images, which makes navigating new spaces or sketching complex three-dimensional structures come easily to me, while making up my mind regarding what dish to order at a restaurant, or what course to choose from the offered bouquet in the upcoming semester are much harder questions, since I don't like eliminating options I have no clue about. Only when I've organized something mentally do I make my choices, and as a result I spend quite a bit of time with menus. Nevertheless, it's that same desire to try out everything before making well-informed decisions regarding my likes and dislikes that lead me to take courses across the board, before I made up my mind to pursue my research interests interests in the fields of <b>Machine Learning</b>, <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> and <b>Natural Language Processing,</b> and the application of <b>Social Network Analysis</b> in these domains to better understand real-world data, and the use <b>Graph Theory and Algorithms</b> in these areas to better formulate ideas.</p>
<p>Currently, my research efforts have been directed towards understanding the representation of word meanings as tensors, and drawing parallels between the resulting mathematical framework and quantum mechanics, as part of my undergraduate thesis. Yet another problem I am pursuing this semester is the handling of diversity in reverse top-k queries. Apart from this, my most recent research stint was at Microsoft Research India, Bangalore, where I spent a very fruitful summer as a Research Intern in the Mobility Networks and Systems Group, under the guidance of Dr. Krishna Chintalapudi. The project involved working with cutting-edge smart glasses technology, to enable screen to glass data transmission via an imperceptible visual side channel.</p>
<p>When I'm not busy working on an assignment or pursuing a challenging problem, you can find me reading something or the other. I'm also an avid gamer, and look upon games as an art form by themselves, what with their storylines and true-to-life graphical details. However, that hobby has been put on the back-burner for more than a year now, with random bouts of coding having taken its place, either of the competitive or the one-day hack kinds.</p>
<p>On the extra-curricular front, I've participated in and won quizzes, elocutions and essay writing competitions, apart from having addressed large gatherings on several occasions, either on the occasion of some event, or as the narrator or protagonist in school plays. I also learned to play the mridangam for two years, after which I went on to learning to play the keyboard for another five years, before finally moving on to the drums, which I learned to play for a year. Quite some time has passed since I played any of them, and I do hope I get the time to get back to playing them sometime&hellip;</p>
<p>I was born in the city of Mumbai, or Bombay as it was called back then, and soon shifted to Muscat, Oman, where I spent the first two years of my life. I then shifted to Chennai, and have been here ever since, right from pre-school to college.</p>

And if you're one of those people (like me!) who prefer a sleek command line interface over a slow, bloated GUI, you could have a look at <a href="terminal.html">this</a>.</p>
